# Cooking with the Permaweb

The Permaweb Cookbook is a developer resource that provides the essential concepts and references for building applications on Arweave. Each concept and reference will focus on specific aspects of the Permaweb development ecosystem while providing additional details and usage examples.

For those interested in creating smart contracts in particular, consider checking out the [AO Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.net) which covers the decentralized compute platform built on top of AO. 

## Developers

Welcome to the Arweave development community, where the past is forever etched in the blockchain and the future is full of endless possibilities. Let's build the decentralized web together!
