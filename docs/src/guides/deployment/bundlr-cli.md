# Bundlr CLI

## Requirements
An Arweave wallet is required to deploy. If the size of the directory is greater than 100kb, a <a href="#fund-bundlr">funded Bundlr instance is required</a>.

## Installation

To install the Bundlr CLI run 
```console
yarn global add @bundlr-network/client
```
or 
```console
npm install -g @bundlr-network/client
```

## Static Build
Permaweb applications are statically generated, meaning that the code and content are generated ahead of time and stored on the network.

Below is an example of a static site. To deploy this to the Permaweb, the `build` directory will be passed in as the argument for the `upload-dir` flag.

```js
|- build
    |- index.html
    |- styles.css
    |- index.js
```

## Deploying

```console
bundlr upload-dir [path to folder] -w  --index-file [index.html] [path to wallet] -c [currency] -h [bundlr node]
```
