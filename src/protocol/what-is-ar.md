# What is $AR?

Decentralized networks such as Arweave often need an incentive mechanism.

Nodes need a reason to store data, mine blocks, and process transactions.

The main incentive mechanism for storing data is Arweave's native token - **$AR**.

## Transactions

$AR is to facilitate transactions on Arweave.

Every transaction on Arweave costs some amount of $AR. This could be to pay for a data upload to the network, or to send $AR from one account to another (also known as wallet-to-wallet transactions). 

$AR is also emitted to miners as block rewards.

To get a general idea of how much uploads on Arweave cost (in $AR), you can use [Arweave Fees](https://ar-fees.arweave.net/).

## Winston

The smallest denomination of $AR is called a Winston. This is similar to how Bitcoin's smallest unit is a "sat", or Ethereum's smallest unit is a "wei".

Some simple conversions include:

- `1 AR = 1000000000000 Winston` (12 zeros)
- `1 Winston = 0.000000000001 AR`

When using Arweave's [HTTP API](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/arweave-node-server/http-api), all amounts are returned in Winston.
