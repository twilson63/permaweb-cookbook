# The Arweave Protocol 

This section covers the Arweave Protocol in some detail; ideally enough for developers to understand the platform they are building on.

Arweave is a blockchain, and shares some similiarites with other blockchains at its core. 

This section assumes no prior knowledge of blockchain technology, and introduces the design of the network in such a manner. If you already understand how blockchain works, you may still find this section useful to learn about Arweave's key differences (focus on storage, tokenomics, separation of concerns, etc.).

In this section, we will discuss: 
- Arweave's protocol design
- The properties and purpose of $AR
- The role of the endowment fund

If you already know how Arweave works, you may find skipping to [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md) or [Guides](../guides/index.md) more useful.
