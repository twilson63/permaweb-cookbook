# Guides

Step-by-step tutorials and practical guides for building on the Permaweb. Guides are currently being reorganized for better user experience.

## Current Resources

While we reorganize, you can find existing guides in:
- [Posting Transactions](./posting-transactions/) - How to send data to Arweave
- [Deploying Manifests](./deploying-manifests/) - Publishing applications and websites
- [Deployment Tools](../tooling/deployment/) - CLI tools and automation
- [Querying Arweave](../tooling/graphql/) - Finding and retrieving data

## Framework Integration

Development kits and framework integrations are being moved to dedicated sections for better organization.
