# Gateways in the Arweave Network

Gateways serve as the interface between the Arweave network and end-users, making permaweb data easily accessible through standard web browsers. Often described as the "front door to the permaweb," these services allow users to interact with blockchain-stored content in a familiar web-like experience.

When you access content on Arweave, you typically use a URL structure like:

```
https://<gateway>/<tx>
```

This allows HTML files to render as web pages, images to display properly, and other data types to be served appropriatelyâ€”creating an experience similar to the traditional web despite the content being stored on a decentralized network.

## Key Functions of Gateways

Gateways provide several critical services beyond basic content delivery:

- **Content Caching**: Store frequently accessed transactions to improve performance
- **Data Indexing**: Provide GraphQL interfaces for querying transactions by tags and metadata
- **Network Seeding**: Help distribute transactions throughout the Arweave network
- **Content Moderation**: Apply content policies to determine which data is served

## Relationship to Core Protocol

It's important to understand that gateways are **not part of the core Arweave protocol**. This distinction has several implications:

- Operating a gateway is separate from running a node that secures the network
- There is no built-in protocol-level incentive structure for gateway operators
- Gateway services can implement their own economic models and incentives
- Applications can operate their own gateways for improved performance

This separation allows for a more flexible and decentralized ecosystem where different gateway operators can experiment with various service models.

## Popular Gateway Services

Several gateway services currently serve the Arweave ecosystem:

- [arweave.net](https://arweave.net/) - Operated by the Arweave team
- [arweave.world](https://cookbook.arweave.world/)
- [arweave.asia](https://cookbook.arweave.asia)
- [arweave.live](https://arweave.live/)
- [g8way.io](https://g8way.io)

The AR.IO project is working to make gateway operation more accessible, potentially increasing the decentralization of access points to the network.
