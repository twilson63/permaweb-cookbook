# Transactions

Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Arweave network. This section covers how transactions work, how to post them, and the different types available for various use cases.

## Core Transaction Concepts

All data on Arweave is stored as transactions. Each transaction contains data and metadata (tags) that can be queried and retrieved. Understanding these concepts is essential for building on the permaweb.

## Transaction Guides

### [Transaction Tags](./tags.md) 
Discover how to use tags to organize and query transaction data. Tags are key-value pairs that make transactions discoverable and enable complex applications on Arweave. 

### [Transaction Bundles](./bundles.md)
