# Transactions

Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Arweave network. 

This section covers how transactions work, how to post them, and how they can be bundled together for efficiency.

## Key Concepts

All data on Arweave is stored as transactions. Each transaction contains data and metadata (tags) that can be queried and retrieved.

Transactions can be posted directly to the network or bundled together through bundling services for improved efficiency and guaranteed settlement.
