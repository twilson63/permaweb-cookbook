# Transactions

Transactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Arweave network. This section covers how transactions work, how to post them, and how they can be bundled together for efficiency.

## Transaction Types

- **[Posting Transactions](./post-transactions.md)** - Learn the different ways to post transactions to Arweave
- **[Bundles](./bundles.md)** - Understand how multiple transactions can be bundled together
- **[Transaction Types](./transaction-types.md)** - Different types of transactions and their use cases
- **[Tags](./tags.md)** - Transaction metadata system for organizing and querying data

## Key Concepts

Every transaction on Arweave contains data and metadata (tags). Transactions can be posted directly to the network or bundled together through bundling services for improved efficiency and guaranteed settlement.
