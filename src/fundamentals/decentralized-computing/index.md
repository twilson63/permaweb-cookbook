# Decentralized Computing

The Permaweb enables a new paradigm of decentralized computing that goes beyond simple data storage. Through technologies like AO and HyperBEAM, developers can build sophisticated applications that run permanently and trustlessly on a global, decentralized computer.

## Overview

Traditional computing relies on centralized servers and cloud providers, creating single points of failure and control. Decentralized computing on the Permaweb distributes computation across a network of nodes, ensuring permanence, censorship resistance, and trustless execution.

### Key Components

**AO Processes** - Autonomous computational units that maintain state and execute logic permanently on Arweave
**HyperBEAM** - The production implementation of AO-Core that provides HTTP access to decentralized computing resources

**Decentralized Computing Architecture:**

```
User/Application
       ↓ (HTTP Request)
   HyperBEAM Node ←──────→ HTTP Response
       ↓ (Route Message)
   AO Process ←──────→ Other AO Process
       ↓ (Execute Logic)      (Messages)
 Lua/WASM Runtime
       ↓ (Update State)
   Arweave Storage

Decentralized Computing Network:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Node 1  Node 2  Node 3  ... Node N │
│   ↑       ↑       ↑          ↑     │
│   └───────┼───────┼──────────┘     │
│           └───────┘                │
│     (Distributed across network)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This system enables permanent, trustless computation where HyperBEAM nodes provide HTTP access to AO processes that execute on various runtimes and persist state to Arweave.

## Core Concepts

### Permanent Computation

Unlike traditional serverless functions that can be shut down or modified, AO processes run permanently on the Arweave network. Once deployed, they continue executing indefinitely without requiring maintenance or hosting fees.

### Trustless Execution

All computation is cryptographically verifiable. Results can be independently verified by anyone, eliminating the need to trust centralized providers or intermediaries.

### Message-Based Architecture

AO processes communicate through asynchronous message passing, enabling sophisticated distributed computing patterns while maintaining consistency and ordering.

### Device Modularity

HyperBEAM's device architecture allows different computational engines (Lua, WebAssembly, custom modules) to be plugged in as needed, creating a flexible and extensible computing environment.

## Why Decentralized Computing Matters

### Permanence
- Applications never go offline or disappear
- No vendor lock-in or platform dependencies  
- Permanent accessibility for users worldwide

### Censorship Resistance
- No single authority can shut down applications
- Global network distribution prevents blocking
- Permissionless participation in the network

### Economic Efficiency
- Pay once for permanent deployment
- No ongoing hosting or maintenance costs
- Competitive pricing through decentralized markets

### Trust Minimization
- Cryptographically verifiable execution
- Open source and auditable code
- Mathematical guarantees instead of institutional trust

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Traditional Cloud | Decentralized Computing |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Uptime** | 99.9% SLA | 100% (permanent) |
| **Control** | Platform controlled | User controlled |
| **Costs** | Monthly recurring | One-time deployment |
| **Scalability** | Manual scaling | Automatic network scaling |
| **Verification** | Trust-based | Cryptographically provable |
| **Censorship** | Platform policies | Censorship resistant |
