# Getting Started

Welcome to the Permaweb Cookbook! This book contains concepts, guides, and snippets to help you get started building decentralized applications on Arweave.

## What is the Permaweb?

The Permaweb is a global, community-owned web that anyone can contribute to or get paid to maintain. It's built on top of Arweave, a decentralized storage network that permanently stores data.

Creating and deploying applications on Arweave is similar to creating traditional applications - with the key difference that applications uploaded to Arweave are immutable, decentralized, and cannot be individually removed. These properties can make building on Arweave challenging, but rewarding.

This cookbook aims to make the process of learning and building simpler. 

## Getting Started

The [Quick Start guides](./quick-starts/hw-cli.md) in the next chapter aim to give a brief overview of what it looks like to deploy a "Hello World" application to Arweave, using both CLI tools and code.

## Next Steps

Once you've completed the getting started guide, explore:
- [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md) to understand how Arweave works
- [Guides](../guides/index.md) for step-by-step tutorials
- [Tooling](../tooling/index.md) for development tools
