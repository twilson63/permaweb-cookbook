# Getting Started

The [Quick Start guides](./quick-starts/hw-cli.md) in the next chapter aim to give a brief overview of what it looks like to deploy a "Hello World" application to Arweave, using both CLI tools and code.

## Next Steps

- [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/index.md) to understand how Arweave works
- [Guides](../guides/index.md) for step-by-step tutorials
