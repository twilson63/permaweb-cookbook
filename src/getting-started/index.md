# Getting Started

Welcome to the Permaweb Cookbook! This guide will help you get started building decentralized applications on Arweave.

## Start Here

- **[Welcome & Overview](./welcome.md)** - Introduction to Arweave and the Permaweb
- **[Zero-deployed Minimal Full Stack App](./quick-starts/hw-no-code.md)** - Build your first app without writing code
- **[Contributing](./contributing.md)** - How to contribute to this cookbook

## What is the Permaweb?

The Permaweb is a global, community-owned web that anyone can contribute to or get paid to maintain. It's built on top of Arweave, a decentralized storage network that permanently stores data.

## Quick Start Options

Choose your path based on your experience level:

1. **No-Code** - Use visual tools to deploy your first app
2. **Frontend Developer** - Deploy a React/Vue/Svelte app
3. **Full-Stack** - Build applications with data storage
4. **Blockchain Developer** - Integrate with smart contracts
