## Style

Here are some suggestions on tone and style from some contributors:

::: tip
In writing them, I'm getting a feeling for the tone that's appropriate for each.
CoreConcepts should be rather textbook like, neutral voice, objective.  "This is how Arweave works"
For Guides, I think it's ok to have a more personal voice. Refer to the reader as "you" and speak in the collaborative voice "next we'll take a look at..."
This may just be personal preference, but in general I feel this tone much more supportive and accessible when following a longer form guide.
Indeed, its the voice that most popular tutorials from other ecosystems are written in.
For Resources, I think it shares the same voice as core concepts, with a preference for brevity.

::: tip
Conceptual and referencial data should have a more cold scientific tone and guides should be a supportive or even humorous tone. Longer form content needs to pull readers in without them zoning out.
