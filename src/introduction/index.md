# Introduction

Welcome to the Arweave cookbook!

This is a comprehensive guide for developers on how Arweave works, how to generate wallets and upload data, and how to create applications. 

# Who is the cookbook for? 

The Arweave cookbook is for anyone interested in understanding Arweave and its parts in more detail, or who wants to build applications or accomplish tasks programmatically on Arweave.

The cookbook assumes you have some familiarity with programming, and most code snippets in the [Guides](../guides/index.md) section will be provided in JavaScript/TypeScript.

# How to read the cookbook

The cookbook is intended to be read linearly, but some sections can be skipped or referred back to where appropriate.

The first section of the cookbook is focused on the [Arweave Protocol](../protocol/index.md). This section explains the base layer which developers will build applications on top of, and aims to answer the whats and the whys of Arweave.

The second section covers the fundamental concepts and building blocks necessary for developers. This includes [Accounts](../fundamentals/wallets-and-keyfiles/index.md), [Transactions](../fundamentals/transactions/index.md), and more.

The third section gets into the nitty-gritty of building on (and using) Arweave as a developer. This is the largest and most granular part of the cookbook, and includes detailed guides to achieve specific tasks on Arweave. Some examples include publishing websites, using CI/CD tooling, and setting up wallet connections for applications. 

The final section is a set of [references](../references/index.md) that may be useful for developers. This includes a glossary, protocol specifications, and links to relevant APIs/SDKs.

Want to start building immediately? If you already have a wallet and know the theory, you can head straight to our [Quick Starts](../getting-started/quick-starts/hw-code.md).
