# Vue Starter Kits

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that allows building user interfaces. Unlike other frameworks, it compiles the template into JavaScript during runtime, resulting in a smaller file size and faster performance. Vue is ideal for building performant and scalable single-page applications, making it a popular choice among front-end developers.
