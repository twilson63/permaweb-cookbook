# Svelte Starter Kits

Svelte is a framework that compiles to a JavaScript bundle and in the process removes the framework from the distribution of the app. This results in a much smaller footprint than other frameworks. Svelte is the perfect framework for Permaweb Applications. A Permaweb Application is built on the principles of a Single Page Application, but lives on the Arweave network and is distributed by Permaweb gateways.

Svelte Starter Kit Guides:

* [Minimal](./minimal.md) - the minimum required to build a svelte permaweb app
* [Vite](./vite.md) - Svelte, Typescript and Vite

::: info Permaweb Application Constraints
* 100% Front-end application (No Server-Side Backend)
* Applications are served from a sub-path (https://[gateway]/[TX_ID])
