üëçüéâFirst off, thanks for taking the time to contributeüéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines on how to contribute

## What should I know before I get started?

### Permaweb Cookbook Layout

The cookbook is layed out in 5 different sections.

| Section         | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Getting Started | Resources for starting development on Permaweb                    |
| Core Concepts   | Building blocks of Permaweb that are good to know for development |
| Guides          | Snack-sized guides about different tools for development          |
| References      | References to commonly needed code snippets                       |
| Kits            | Starter Kits with development frameworks                          |

Depending on what you are writing, it will live in one of these sections

#### References

References are an overarching topic with a list of references of how to do
things under that topic. The general structure is the following:

```

```

Guides are longer form informational documentation on various topics.
The general structure for writing a guide is the following:

```

```
